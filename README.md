Bold is a tool in the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) space, which allows you to start with an UML model of your application and a set of business rules written in a high level language and “execute” the model after creating a graphical user interface for it.
Bold includes a sophisticated object-relational mapping layer, ability to map data to multiple formats, changes synchronization, and much more. It includes a large amount of IDE integrated tools and options to work with external UML modeling software.
