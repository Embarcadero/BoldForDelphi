# BoldForDelphi

The original source code of the Bold library for Delphi
Version 4.0.1.0 Bold for Delphi, Release 4.0 - 2004-04-23

Bold is a tool in the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) space, which allows you to start with an UML model of your application and a set of business rules written in a high level language and “execute” the model after creating a graphical user interface for it.
Bold includes a sophisticated object-relational mapping layer, ability to map data to multiple formats, changes synchronization, and much more. It includes a large amount of IDE integrated tools and options to work with external UML modeling software.
