<H3>4.0.1.0 Bold for Delphi, Release 4.0 - 2004-04-23 </H3>

Bugfixes: 
* QC 4679: SqlScripts for Db evolution can now be configured with separator, terminator and commands for transaction start/commit. Logs can be saved from the evolution dialog.
* QC 3546: Fixed performance bottleneck in formsaver when creating/modifying lots of objects
* QC 4188: XMI import performance improved (debug logging disabled)
* QC 7110: Childmapping the rootclass would cause AV when loading objects. It is still not recommended to childmap the rootclass though.
* QC 3123: Changed the order in which transactions are started and operations performed when optimistic locking is used. Checking the condition and storing the new values are now performed in the same transaction. ID and Timestamp generation is performed in separate transactions in advance
* QC 3904: When Shift-Tab was pressed in the BoldGrid, focus was incorrectly painted
* QC 3227: Fixed occasional AV in TBoldEnvironmentConfiguration.DeactivateDisplayQueue
* QC 4870: Fixed the adjustment of OldValues when saving singlelinks. This problem would cause a IndexOutOfBounds error if an object was removed from a multilink, the changes saved, and then the object deleted and saved.
* QC 3093: Improved errormessage when a class is set as association class twice
* QC 6482/2959: BoldSystemDebuggerAction now handles manual closing of the form more gracefully
* QC 3146: Fixed implementation of OCL-operation "IncludesAll" 
* QC 3903: The Bold grid would apply the current value to the wrong cell when moving out of the cell with Left/Right keys
* Added a new error message when an object from another system is sent to UpdateDatabaseWithList
* Added a possibility to disable the undo-mechanism: aBoldSystem.UndoHandlerInterface.Enabled := false. This will avoid data from clogging up the undo-handler (with the price that nothing can be undone)
* Misc improvements for DOA interfaces (including better support for datetime, named parameters and blobs)
* The existence of related objects are now checked if optimistic locking is on
* Combobox now handles keyboard navigation better in SetReference-mode
* BoldLogHandlerForm now receives notification if its form is destroyed to avoid an AV when the loghandler is destroyed
* Calling BoldCombobox.Changed manually will now call the OnSelectChanged event.
* Added an extra ADOQuery.Close before setting the SQL to avoid "invalid operation" for open queries.
* Improved speed of ADO queries by setting Cachesize (10000), CursorType (ForwardOnly) and LockType (ReadOnly) in the query initialization
* BoldGrid would throw an AV if goEditing was false and user pressed DEL-key in a cell. Fixed.
* XMI export now handles multiplicity "0..n" as well as "0..*"
* It is no longer possible to link objects from different systems to each other.
* Fixed validation of parent mapped classes with non-persistent attributes that does not allow null (will not generate a warning anymore)
* Fixed infinite recursion bug in TBoldUnorderedIndexableList.KnowsSupportsNil.
* DbDataValidator will now add a remedy line if the database is not connected forcing the execute-method to return false
* Fixed problem with DbDataValidation and Child/Parent-mapped classes
* Fixed incorrect format string when validating model and two clases Parent/child-maps to each others tables
* Changed implementation of TBoldObjectList.GetBoldObject to ensure that using assertions is a sideeffect free operation. It could cause AVs before if the object happed to be deleted

<H3>4.0.0.21 Bold for Delphi, Release 4.0 - 2003-02-14 (The Valentine Release) </H3>

Bugfixes:
* BoldPMappersDefault: Default BlobMapper now uses the SQLDatabaseConfig.FieldTypeForBlob when creating parameters to store a blob. This fixes a problem with the error "Parameter object is improperly defined. Inconsistent or incomplete information was provided" when storing memo-blobs in a SQLServer database using ADO (and possibly similar cases)
* BoldExceptionHandlersCom, BoldExceptionHandlers: Improved searching for matching exception handler. While optimization could have been somewhat harder, we're facing an exception, which will be more expensive at any rate. 
* BoldComboBox: Combobox now behaves better when navigated via keyboard speed keys. 
* BoldComboBox, BoldEdit, BoldLabel, BoldMemo (QC 3396): Fixed problem with lost ParentColor-property.
* BoldControlPackCom, BoldControlPack: Components with bapChange will continue to apply their values when changed even if an exception occured during a previous apply
* BoldSystem: If a derived attribute causes an exception during calculation of its value, it will be recalculated at next access (hoping the calculation will succeed) instead of going permanently dead.
* BoldSystemPersistenceHandler: Calling FetchLinksWithObjects with an empty list does not cause an indexoutofbounds anymore
* BoldUMLSupport: Fixed a bug that would cause an AV when unboldifying a model with implicitly transient associations
* BoldDeriver: Derived attributes that causes an exception during their derivation will not become permanently dead but try to rederive themselves on next access instead.

Other:
* BoldSystem: Added a parameter to BoldSystem.FetchLinksWithObjects to retrieve the list of objects that were fetched as a result of the call
* BoldAbstractModel (QC 3281): AbstractModel now has ComponentStyle set to not include csInheritable. It is thus no longer possible to inherit it using form inheritance.
* BoldUMLModelEditForm (QC 2811): The treeview has a min width constraint = 200 to avoid resizing issues. 
* BoldUMLModelEditForm (QC 2812): The checkboxes get hint = caption at form create. 
* BoldGeneratorTemplatesDelphi: Improved instructions regarding generating .tlb-files

<H3>4.0.0.20 Bold for Delphi, Release 4.0 - 2003-01-xx </H3>

BugFixes:
* BoldOLLEDistributableObjectHandlers (QC 3074): Fixed access violation in OLLE 
* BoldSystem (QC 3012):  Fixed bug in TBoldSystem.RollbackTransaction that would cause rollback of a nested transaction to have no effect (especially it would not cause the outermost transaction to fail) 
* BoldSystemPersistenceHandler: When updating a list with embedded relations to unsaved objects that are not in the list, the related objects would be saved (created in the db), but their state would not be correctly updated so if they were subsequently updated, the persistence mapper would again try to insert the objects thus causing a primary key violation. 
* UMLEditor: Fixed AV with CTRL-ALT-S when an attribute is selected
* BoldFormSaver: Plugged minor memoryleak in TBoldFormSaver
* BoldUMLXMIImporter: Fixes to prevent tagged values to be created multiple times when importing.

Other:
* BoldSystem: Added errormessage when calling Memberfactory with a type that does not have an installed delphi type
* BoldPersistenceHandleFile: Added detection of trying to fetch an object that does not exist in the file (would cause StackOverflow before)
* BoldIBInterfaces: Improved errormessage when login dialog is required but missing in application
* BoldBase: Moved IFDEFs in TBoldMemoryManagedObject to allow non SCALA users to define BOLD_DISABLEMEMORYMANAGER
* BoldGen: Moved private virtual method InitializeTemplateForComponent to protected section
* BoldUMLMMLink: Added rudimentary export support in the sense that the BLD-file is pushed over to MM. There is, however, no one there to handle it!
* BoldUMLXMIImporter: Now supporting visibility scope package to be interpreted as public.

<H3>4.0.0.19 Bold for Delphi, Release 4.0 - 2002-10-xx </H3>

* BoldSqlNodes.pas: fix for joining tables correctly when OCL expression is rooted in list
* BoldModelOCLValidatorPlugIn.pas: OCL-plugin will now automatically boldify the model before validation (would normally cause an AV if model was not boldified)
* BoldUMLRose98Link.pas: Bugfix: Rose-export now handles broken generalizations (that could be a result of manually modifying a boldified model and then unboldifying it)
* BoldDatabaseAdapterDBIsam.pas: fixed initialization of database engine to dbeDBISAM
* BoldEnvironment.pas: Fixed problem with occasional AV when terminating the application before the queue was finalized
* BoldMD5.pas: Fixed problem with calculating checksum for 63 byte long messages (would cause range-error if compiled with rangechecks)

Other:
